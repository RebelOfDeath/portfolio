abstract: Automated unit test generators, particularly search-
  based software testing tools like EvoSuite, are capable of generat-
  ing tests with high coverage. Although these generators alleviate
  the burden of writing unit tests, they often pose challenges for
  software engineers in terms of understanding the generated tests.
  To address this, we introduce UTGen, which combines search-
  based software testing and large language models to enhance
  the understandability of automatically generated test cases. We
  achieve this enhancement through contextualizing test data,
  improving identifier naming, and adding descriptive comments.
  Through a controlled experiment with 32 participants from
  both academia and industry, we investigate how the understand-
  ability of unit tests affects a software engineerâ€™s ability to perform
  bug-fixing tasks. We selected bug-fixing to simulate a real-world
  scenario that emphasizes the importance of understandable test
  cases. We observe that participants working on assignments with
  UTGen test cases fix up to 33% more bugs and use up to 20%
  less time when compared to baseline test cases. From the post-test
  questionnaire, we gathered that participants found that enhanced
  test names, test data, and variable names improved their bug-
  fixing process.
